quality_notes:
  strengths:
    - "Clean separation of concerns (Api, Core, Infrastructure)"
    - "Records for immutable data models"
    - "Proper dependency injection throughout"
    - "Error handling with logging in OpenRouteService"
    - "File-based caching reduces API calls"
  observations:
    - severity: low
      note: "OpenRouteService returns 0 on error - acceptable for POC, consider explicit error propagation for production"
    - severity: low
      note: "No input validation on lat/lon - acceptable for POC scope"

recommendations:
  future:
    - action: "Add input validation for coordinates before production"
      refs: ["src/Hemglass.ETA.Api/Program.cs"]
    - action: "Consider explicit error handling instead of returning 0 travel time"
      refs: ["src/Hemglass.ETA.Infrastructure/OpenRouteService.cs"]
